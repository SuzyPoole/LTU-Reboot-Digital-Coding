    <h2>Reflection</h2> 
    
    <p>Today we learned about using Github and Visual Code Studio.</p>
    
    <p>It was really interesting to see how some of the programmes work and good to start creating some content.
    
        I'm looking forward to creating lots more!</p>
    
    <p>I found it quite easy to follow. It seems to be easier to follow working on a Mac as screens match up more.</p>
    
    <p>It's nice to learn with other people rather than trying to plough through on your own, especially at the moment.
    
        I'm really enjoying the course.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you! </p>

    <p>This on our development branch only</p>
