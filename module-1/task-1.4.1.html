    Reflection 
    
    Today we learned about using Github and Visual Code Studio.
    
    It was really interesting to see how some of the programmes work and good to start creating some content.
    
    I'm looking forward to creating lots more!
    
    I found it quite easy to follow. It seems to be easier to follow working on a Mac as screens match up more.
    
    It's nice to learn with other people rather than trying to plough through on your own, especially at the moment.
    
    I'm really enjoying the course.
    
    Thank you!
