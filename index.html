    <h1>1.3. - 30/09/20</h1> <!--h1 is a heading with the highest importance-->

    <h2>Reflection</h2> 
    
    <p>Today we learned about using Github and Visual Code Studio.</p>
    
    <p>It was really interesting to see how some of the programmes work and good to start creating some content.
    
        I'm looking forward to creating lots more!</p>
    
    <p>I found it quite easy to follow. It seems to be easier to follow working on a Mac as screens match up more.</p>
    
    <p>It's nice to learn with other people rather than trying to plough through on your own, especially at the moment.
    
        I'm really enjoying the course.</p>

<h1>1.4. - 01/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>We have now started to learn tags, which is great. These have always been 'mysterious' characters on a page so starting to understand them is really interesting.
    It's like learning a new language.</p>
<p>We learned how to make headings and new paragraphs. And we got to see our work on-line for the first time :-)</p>
<p>Through doing this, we have been regulalry comitting and pushing our work through to GitHub so these processes are 
    becoming much more easy and more second-nature to us.</p>
<p>We also learned about branches so we now have insight into how developers might work together on one website. </p>
<p>I have downloaded some apps so I can start learning code over the wekend. I'm worried I might become addicted!</p>



<h1>3.2. - 13/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>We learned about JS functions and control flow today.</p>
<p>We were told about declaring a functiona and then how to invoke it.</p>
<p>We were shown how to input values called arguments into functions. We can also use variables in these functions.</p>
<p>We were told how to use return so we can use numbers later on and the difference between local and Global scope.</p>
<p>We also started to use Boolean variables in our text editor used the if function.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear why local and global scope was useful.</p>
<p>I found it fairly easy to follow - the most complicated idea was using the return value so it would be good to see how this is used in practice.</p>
