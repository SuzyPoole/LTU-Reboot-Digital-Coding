    <h1>1.3. - 30/09/20</h1> <!--h1 is a heading with the highest importance-->

    <h2>Reflection</h2> 
    
    <p>Today we learned about using Github and Visual Code Studio.</p>
    
    <p>It was really interesting to see how some of the programmes work and good to start creating some content.
    
        I'm looking forward to creating lots more!</p>
    
    <p>I found it quite easy to follow. It seems to be easier to follow working on a Mac as screens match up more.</p>
    
    <p>It's nice to learn with other people rather than trying to plough through on your own, especially at the moment.
    
        I'm really enjoying the course.</p>

<h1>1.4. - 01/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>We have now started to learn tags, which is great. These have always been 'mysterious' characters on a page so starting to understand them is really interesting.
    It's like learning a new language.</p>
<p>We learned how to make headings and new paragraphs. And we got to see our work on-line for the first time :-)</p>
<p>Through doing this, we have been regulalry comitting and pushing our work through to GitHub so these processes are 
    becoming much more easy and more second-nature to us.</p>
<p>We also learned about branches so we now have insight into how developers might work together on one website. </p>
<p>I have downloaded some apps so I can start learning code over the wekend. I'm worried I might become addicted!</p>



<h1>3.2. - 13/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>We learned about JS functions and control flow today.</p>
<p>We were told about declaring a functiona and then how to invoke it.</p>
<p>We were shown how to input values called arguments into functions. We can also use variables in these functions.</p>
<p>We were told how to use return so we can use numbers later on and the difference between local and Global scope.</p>
<p>We also started to use Boolean variables in our text editor used the if function.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear why local and global scope was useful.</p>
<p>I found it fairly easy to follow - the most complicated idea was using the return value so it would be good to see how this is used in practice.</p>




<h1>3.3. 14/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Today we did some tasks and created a precentage function and calculator. It was really good to compelte them and see how things work in practice more.</p>
<p>We started to use 'switch' instead of if/else and used this in a calculator.</p>
<p>I'm getting more used to reading the text editor and spotting mistakes in syntax.</p>

<h1>3.4. 15/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Today we covered loops, arrays and objects.</p>
<p>It was quite complicated but lots of useful information to take away and interesting tasks <br>
such as times table calculators and lists.></p>

<h1>3.5. 19/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Today we looked at how we could create mean and medians of numbers. It was very complicated and made you look carefully <br>
at how to split up calculations. It was good revision of mathematics too.</p>
<p>We then looked at how to add up prices in shopping carts, which was easy to follow. However, we then took over a <br>
task to apply discount on certain food items, which was really tough. I ended up searching for answers on codepen <br>
as I was desperate for clues on how to get started!</p>


<h1>3.6. 20/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>A good lesson today leanring about DOM (Document Object Model</p>
<p>We learned how to select items and change them with JS.</p>
<p>We also found out how to create nodes from scratch using JS.</p>

>3.7. 21/10/20</h1>
<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Today we learned how to use JS to change the appearance of a button when clicked etc </p>
<p>We were also taught how to stop default settings such as links.</p>
<p>We then started to create a proper page for the first time, using buttons, images and filters. It was great to see how the page was being built up</p>
